# Adverb Timeline  
Have you ever wondered why Mexicans are late for everything? Even as a Mexican myself, I too question this often. I wondered, does language play a role in our tardiness? Or does our language and communication style match our culture of impunctuality? Are people aware that our promises to get somewhere at a certain time mean nothing?  

To answer these questions I looked at a number of somewhat vague yet common adverbs of time and asked people to define the time frame they think these adverbs describe.
On this project I set out to create a timeline that displays the time in which people consider that an action would actually take place if it were described by certain adverbs of time which have ambiguous meanings.
The goal is to analyze the use of colloquial language and its impact on our culture. It can also serve as a tool for people that are learning Spanish, to help them understand how these words are used on a day-to-day basis. 
This is the end-product.  

You can learn more about it by reading my [medium article](https://medium.com/@marciapedrozajv/temporal-equivalencies-for-adverbs-of-time-used-in-spanish-1f6dd7ff53cf) about it. It covers the inspiration behind it, how i designed the experiment, how I created the graph below and most importantly, how language shapes our reality.

*Note: the table of english translations is not plotted beside the graph. The image has been modified to include both figures side by side. The end-result of this project is the figure on the left.*

This project was created using data from a survey I created and distributed among friends, family and acquaintances.
